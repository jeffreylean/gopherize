## Constant and variables

In Go, variables are named storage locations that can hold different values during the execution of the program. Their values can be changed and manipulated as needed. Variables are stored in memory and are strongly typed, which mean their data type is explicitly defined.

Constants, on the other hand, are named storage locations that hold fixed values are immutable during the runtime. Their value are remain the same throughout the program lifetime.
